# ! usually denotes a destructive (mutating) method if used after a method name. However, this is more of a convention then a Ruby syntax. 
# So even if a method ends in !, destructive action actually may not take place.
# ! also means 'NOT' when used before an equal sign (for comparisons)  or before something, such as a variable or 'true' or 'false'.  So, !true would equate to false
# By the same logic !!true would equate to true, for !(!true) would equate to !(false) then to true
# ? is used in the ternary operator for if/else/end.  It's a quick way of writing if/else/end command for an easy logic.  It is used in conjuction with ':'

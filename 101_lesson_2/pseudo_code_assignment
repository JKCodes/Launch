1) a method that returns the sum of two integers

START

# Given two numbers called number1 and number2

number1 formatted to an integer + number2 formatted to an integer

END


2) a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

START

# Given an array of strings

Return if array is nil or is empty

SET iterator = 0
SET result = '' 

WHILE iterator < length of array
  result += string at array at index iterator
  iterator += 1

return result

END

3) a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

START

# Given an array of integers

Return if array is nil or is empty

SET iterator = 0
SET result = []

WHILE iterator < length of array
  push the value at index iterator to the array
  iterator +=2

return result

END
